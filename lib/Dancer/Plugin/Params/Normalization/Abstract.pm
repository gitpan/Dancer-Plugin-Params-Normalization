=head1 NAME

Dancer::Plugin::Params::Normalization::Abstract - class for custom parameters normalization

=head1 VERSION

version 0.50

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This virtual class describes how to build a custom normalization object for
L<Dancer::Plugin::Params::Normalization>. This is done in order to allow
custom transformation of the parameters with a common interface.

Any custom normalization package must inherits from
Dancer::Plugin::Params::Normalization::Abstract and implement the following
abstract methods.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init()

Is called once, on initialization of the class. Can be used to create needed
initialization objects, like a database connection, etc.

=head2 normalize($hashref)

Receives a hashref that contains the parameters keys/value. It should return a
hashref (it can be the same), containing modified parameters.

=head1 NAME
